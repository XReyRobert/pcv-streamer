The program establishes a USB connection with Power Commander 5 using `usb4java`. Tested on Linux. Likely doesn't work on OSX and Windows because neither of them releases the device.

Power Commander 5 is a USB HID device with two interfaces, one for reading and the other for writing. For more information refer to http://pisarenko.net/blog/2017/04/17/internet-connected-motorcycle-project-part-2/
